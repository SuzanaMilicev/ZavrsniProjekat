            <h1>GIVE WITH MEANING</h1>
            <p class="pt-1 col-10">For over 110 years, as the floral-gifting experts,
                we’ve been helping you give with more care, with greater ease, and with more meaning.<br>
                Established in 1910 as a collective of 10 florists, Florists’ Transworld Delivery (FTD) used the
                telegraph to transform the age-old practice of flower-giving. We understood then the unique power of
                flowers to express a sentiment and helped people across the world “Say it with flowers.” Today, we have
                grown
                into an extensive network made up of thousands of local florists — each one an artisan who is
                handcrafting and
                hand-delivering fine bouquets all across the country.
                <br>
                When you’re giving with FTD you’re giving the gift of joy, strength, and love and you're giving it with
                meaning.
